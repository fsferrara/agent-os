# Product Roadmap

1. [x] Core Framework Structure — Establish the 3-layer directory structure (standards, product, specs) with base templates and documentation for organizing AI agent context `M`

2. [x] Standards System — Create comprehensive coding standards library covering global conventions, backend patterns, frontend patterns, and testing practices that AI agents can reference `L`

3. [x] Product Planning Workflow — Implement `/plan-product` command that guides users through creating mission.md, roadmap.md, and tech-stack.md with structured templates `M`

4. [x] Spec Initialization Workflow — Build `/shape-spec` command that creates dated spec folders with proper structure, planning files, and initial context gathering `M`

5. [x] Spec Writing System — Develop `/write-spec` command that generates detailed specifications with requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation guidance following best practices `L`

6. [x] Task Breakdown System — Create `/create-tasks` command that analyzes specs and generates actionable task lists with checkboxes, dependencies, and effort estimates `M`

7. [x] Implementation Workflow — Build `/implement-tasks` command that guides AI agents through executing development tasks while following all 3 context layers `L`

8. [x] Verification System — Implement validation framework that checks completed work against standards, product vision, and spec requirements automatically `M`

9. [x] Multi-Agent Orchestration — Develop `/orchestrate-tasks` command that coordinates specialized agents (spec-writer, implementer, verifier) to collaborate on complex features `L`

10. [x] Profile System — Create reusable profile configurations (agents, commands, standards, workflows) that can be shared across projects and customized per team `M`

11. [ ] GitHub Copilot Integration — Install standards as copilot instructions `S`

12. [ ] GitHub Copilot Integration — Install commands as copilot prompts `M`

> Notes
> - Items 1-10 represent the current implemented state of Agent OS
> - Item 11 is the next priority: GitHub Copilot integration
> - Item 12 represents future automation capabilities
> - Each item represents end-to-end functional features
> - Order reflects technical dependencies and incremental product evolution
