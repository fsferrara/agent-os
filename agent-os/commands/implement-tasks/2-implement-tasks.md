Now that you have the task group(s) to be implemented, proceed with implementation by following these instructions:

Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md, requirements.md, and visuals (if any)
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Display confirmation and next step

Display a summary of what was implemented.

IF all tasks are now marked as done (with `- [x]`) in tasks.md, display this message to user:

```
All tasks have been implemented: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`.

NEXT STEP ðŸ‘‰ Run `3-verify-implementation.md` to verify the implementation.
```

IF there are still tasks in tasks.md that have yet to be implemented (marked unfinished with `- [ ]`) then display this message to user:

```
Would you like to proceed with implementation of the remaining tasks in tasks.md?

If not, please specify which task group(s) to implement next.
```
